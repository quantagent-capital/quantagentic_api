    First, ensure you have the PolledNWSAlertsOutput object from the previous task.
    Second, acknowledge you understand that WATCHES = EPISODES and WARNINGS = EVENTS.
    Third, classify alerts into four groups: 
      1. new_events
      2. updated_events
      3. new_episodes
      4. updated_episodes
    
    To do this, perform the following: 
      - Iterate through each filtered alert in the PolledNWSAlertsOutput.
        - Check the message type of the alert.
          - UPDATE message types are: ['CON', 'EXT', 'EXA', 'EXB']
          - CREATE message types are: ['NEW', 'UPG']
        - Check if the alert is a watch or warning.
          - WATCHES = EPISODES
          - WARNINGS = EVENTS
        
      - If the message type is not in the above lists, skip the alert. 
  expected_output: >
    A ClassifiedAlertsOutput object with all four groups populated.
